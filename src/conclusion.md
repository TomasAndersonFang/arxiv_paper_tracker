### Method & Results
- Constructed poison samples using linear optimization techniques considering limited attacker knowledge.  
- Tested on benchmark linear regression and classification datasets (specific datasets not mentioned).  
- Demonstrated high backdoor success rates with only one poison sample, significantly reducing the poisoning budget compared to prior multi-sample attacks.  
- Achieved comparable or superior attack success with fewer resources relative to baseline multi-poison attacks.

### Impact & Limitations
- Highlights critical vulnerabilities in linear models with minimal poisoning, raising the need for robust defense strategies in practical applications.  
- Limitations include focus on linear models only; extending to non-linear or deep models is a promising direction for future work.
