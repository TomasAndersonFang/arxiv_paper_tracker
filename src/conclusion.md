### Method & Results
- Constructed poison samples using linear optimization techniques considering limited attacker knowledge.  
- Tested on benchmark linear regression and classification datasets (specific datasets not mentioned).  
- Demonstrated high backdoor success rates with only one poison sample, significantly reducing the poisoning budget compared to prior multi-sample attacks.  
- Achieved comparable or superior attack success with fewer resources relative to baseline multi-poison attacks.

### Impact & Limitations
- Highlights critical vulnerabilities in linear models with minimal poisoning, raising the need for robust defense strategies in practical applications.  
- Limitations include focus on linear models only; extending to non-linear or deep models is a promising direction for future work.

It leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and enhance forensic analysis of provenance data. The main result demonstrates that LLM-driven techniques significantly improve detection accuracy and investigative efficiency over traditional methods.

### Key Contributions
- Introduces an LLM-based framework for automated provenance forensic analysis in cybersecurity.
- Demonstrates the efficacy of LLMs in interpreting complex, multi-source provenance data for threat detection.
- Provides empirical evidence that LLM integration enhances detection rates and reduces investigation time.

### Method & Results
- Methodology: Utilizes LLMs to parse, correlate, and analyze provenance metadata from diverse system logs and network data to identify threat patterns.
- Datasets/Tools: Employs standard cybersecurity provenance datasets and state-of-the-art LLMs fine-tuned for forensic applications.
- Results: Achieves up to a 20% increase in detection accuracy and reduces manual analysis time by approximately 30%.
- Outperforms baseline rule-based and traditional machine learning provenance analysis techniques consistently across tested scenarios.

### Impact & Limitations
- Impact: Enables more scalable and precise threat investigations, potentially transforming incident response workflows.
- Limitations/Future Work: Requires addressing model interpretability and handling adversarial provenance data; extending to broader threat landscapes remains future work.
