### React-tRace: A Semantics for Understanding React Hooks
**作者**: Jay Lee, Joongwon Ahn, Kwangkeun Yi
**类别**: cs.PL, cs.SE
**发布日期**: 2025-07-07
**链接**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05234v1

#### Executive Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of formally understanding the complex behavior of React Hooks in concurrent UI programming. The authors propose React-tRace, a novel operational semantics specifically designed to model the execution and potential race conditions of React Hooks. Their semantics enables precise reasoning about hooks-related concurrency bugs, verified through theoretical analysis and case studies.

### Key Contributions
- Introduces React-tRace, the first formal semantics tailored for React Hooks’ execution model.
- Provides a framework to detect and understand concurrency bugs unique to hooks usage.
- Demonstrates applicability through formal proofs and practical examples analyzing common hook patterns.

### Method & Results
- Developed an operational semantics capturing React Hooks’ lifecycle and interactions under concurrency.
- Employed formal methods and theoretical modeling rather than empirical datasets.
- Validated semantics by reproducing known concurrency anomalies in React applications.
- Compared to informal or ad-hoc reasoning, React-tRace offers clearer bug identification and systematic analysis.

### Impact & Limitations
- Enables developers and researchers to rigorously analyze hooks’ concurrency properties, improving reliability in React apps.
- Limited to semantic modeling; does not include automated tooling or broad empirical evaluation.
- Future work could integrate React-tRace with static analysis tools or extend it to evolving React features.

### In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code
**作者**: Susmita Das, Madhusudan Ghosh, Priyanka Swami, Debasis Ganguly, Gul Calikli
**类别**: cs.SE, cs.IR
**发布日期**: 2025-07-07
**链接**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1

#### Executive Summary  
This paper investigates the use of in-context learning (ICL) as a method to estimate the functional correctness of code generated by large language models (LLMs). By leveraging examples within the prompt, the approach predicts whether LLM-generated code passes functional correctness tests without explicit execution. Results show that ICL can effectively assess code correctness, improving reliability in automated code generation.

### Key Contributions  
- Introduces in-context learning as an estimator for functional correctness of LLM-generated code, reducing dependency on costly test executions.  
- Demonstrates that prompt-engineered examples enable LLMs to self-evaluate code quality effectively.  
- Provides empirical evaluation comparing ICL-based estimation to traditional correctness assessment methods.

### Method & Results  
- Method: Uses prompt-based examples demonstrating correct/incorrect code snippets to train LLMs to classify new code correctness via in-context learning.  
- Dataset/Tools: Evaluated on standard code generation benchmarks with functional correctness test suites (specific datasets not detailed).  
- Results: ICL achieves up to a X% accuracy in predicting code correctness, outperforming baseline heuristic estimates by Y%.  
- Compared to direct test execution, ICL offers faster and comparably reliable correctness estimation.

### Impact & Limitations  
- Impact: Enables scalable and resource-efficient evaluation of generated code quality, facilitating safer deployment of LLM-based coding assistants.  
- Limitations:  
  - Generalization to diverse coding problems and languages needs exploration.  
  - Effectiveness depends on the quality and representativeness of in-context examples; future work can optimize prompt design.

### Understanding Everything as Code: A Taxonomy and Conceptual Model
**作者**: Haoran Wei, Nazim Madhavji, John Steinbacher
**类别**: cs.SE
**发布日期**: 2025-07-07
**链接**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05100v1

#### Executive Summary  
The paper addresses the growing trend of representing diverse artifacts as code, proposing a unified taxonomy and conceptual model to structure this paradigm. The authors systematically classify "Everything as Code" (EaC) variants and demonstrate how their model aids in understanding and applying EaC principles across domains.

### Key Contributions  
- Introduces a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing different forms of Everything as Code.  
- Develops a conceptual model linking artifacts, processes, and code representations under a unified framework.  
- Provides practical guidelines for adopting EaC in software engineering and related fields.

### Method & Results  
- Conducted a wide literature survey to identify existing EaC manifestations, followed by conceptual synthesis.  
- Employed qualitative analysis to build the taxonomy and validate the conceptual model through case examples.  
- Applied model to multiple scenarios illustrating improved clarity and integration in software development workflows.  
- Quantitative metrics were limited; focus was on conceptual rigor rather than performance benchmarking.

### Impact & Limitations  
- Enables practitioners to systematically leverage code-based models, promoting automation and consistency across systems engineering.  
- Lacks extensive empirical validation or quantitative evaluation, signaling a need for future work on practical tooling and performance assessment.

#### Executive Summary  
This paper addresses the challenge of data labeling accuracy by proposing a hybrid human-AI approach that leverages Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize the division of labeling tasks based on complexity. The method assigns routine labeling tasks to AI for efficiency and reserves complex cases for human experts, improving overall labeling accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant accuracy gains and cost reductions compared to fully manual or fully automated labeling.

### Key Contributions  
- Introduces an MILP-based framework to optimally assign labeling tasks between AI and humans based on difficulty and accuracy trade-offs.  
- Demonstrates improved labeling accuracy and cost-effectiveness by integrating AI for routine data points and humans for complex instances.  
- Provides a novel accuracy-driven task allocation model that balances efficiency with quality in data labeling pipelines.

### Method & Results  
- Formulates the labeling assignment problem as an MILP to maximize accuracy while minimizing labeling cost and human workload.  
- Evaluations conducted on standard image and software engineering datasets requiring complex annotation.  
- Achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over AI-only labeling and reduces human labeling effort by approximately 40%.  
- Outperforms baseline methods that use static or heuristic task allocation.

### Impact & Limitations  
- Enhances labeling workflows by combining AI efficiency with human expertise, beneficial for domains needing high-quality annotated data.  
- Future work may extend the approach to dynamic, real-time task allocation and explore scalability to very large datasets.
